# CONNECTED DOMINATING SET is NP-complete

An undirected graph and a bound `K`. The question is whether some dominating set of at most `K`
vertices induces a connected subgraph: any two vertices of the set are joined by a path whose
vertices all lie in the set.

Encoding: the instance is decoded from a bitstring with the repository's
canonical `MetaMathlibExt.BitstringEncoding`. Undecodable bitstrings, and
bitstrings decoding to malformed instances, are no-instances.

NP-completeness is stated in the same form as the proved results in
`CSLibExt.Computability.Complexity.Karp`: membership in
`MetaMathlibExt.ComplexityTheory.NP`, plus a polynomial-time many-one
reduction from every language in `NP`
(`Cslib.CookLevin.PolyManyOneRed`).
