# PLANAR SUBGRAPH is NP-complete

INSTANCE: a graph `G = (V, E)` and a positive integer `K ≤ |E|`. QUESTION: is there a subset
`E' ⊆ E` with `|E'| ≥ K` such that `G' = (V, E')` is planar?

`E'` is a sublist of the edge list; under `WellFormed` the edge list has no duplicate edges in
either orientation, so the sublist's length is `|E'|` and the edge list's length is `|E|`.
`G' = (V, E')` is the spanning subgraph `edgeGraph n E'` on all `n` vertices. Planarity is the
shared MathlibExt predicate `SimpleGraph.IsPlanar` (a crossing-free straight-line drawing); by
Fáry's theorem this is planarity for finite simple graphs.

Encoding: the instance is decoded from a bitstring with the repository's
canonical `MetaMathlibExt.BitstringEncoding`. Undecodable bitstrings, and
bitstrings decoding to malformed instances, are no-instances.

NP-completeness is stated in the same form as the proved results in
`CSLibExt.Computability.Complexity.Karp`: membership in
`MetaMathlibExt.ComplexityTheory.NP`, plus a polynomial-time many-one
reduction from every language in `NP`
(`Cslib.CookLevin.PolyManyOneRed`).
