# LRU is $k$-competitive

Let $k \ge 1$ and let $c$ be a duplicate-free cache with at most
$k$ pages. Let $e$ be a legal trace of the cache system with capacity $k$ that starts from a
duplicate-free cache with at most $k$ pages, and let $m$ be its number of misses. Then the trace
that LRU with capacity $k$ emits when serving, from $c$, the requests of $e$ in order has at most
$k m + k$ misses.

This is the bound of Sleator and Tarjan for an online and an offline cache of the same size.
