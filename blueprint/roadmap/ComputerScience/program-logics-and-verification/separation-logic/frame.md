# Frame rule

Let $P$, $Q$ and $R$ be heap assertions and $c$ a heap command. Suppose the
separation-logic triple with precondition $P$, command $c$ and postcondition $Q$ is valid, and
suppose that whenever $R$ holds of a store $s$ and a heap $h$, it also holds of $s'$ and $h$ for
every store $s'$ that agrees with $s$ on every variable outside the set of variables that $c$ may
assign to. Then the triple with precondition $P \star R$, command $c$ and postcondition
$Q \star R$ is valid, where $\star$ denotes separating conjunction.
