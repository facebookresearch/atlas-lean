# Weak bisimilarity is bisimilarity of the saturated system

In a labelled transition
system with a silent label $\tau$, write $\Rightarrow$ for the reflexive-transitive
closure of the $\tau$-transition relation. The weak transitions
$s \stackrel{\mu}{\Longrightarrow} t$ are the trivial ones $s \stackrel{\tau}{\Longrightarrow} s$
and the composites $s \Rightarrow s_1 \xrightarrow{\mu} s_2 \Rightarrow t$; the saturated
system has the same states and has the weak transitions as its transitions. Two states are
weakly bisimilar if some bisimulation of the saturated system relates them.
Thus two states are weakly bisimilar if and only if they are bisimilar in the saturated
system; this holds by definition.
