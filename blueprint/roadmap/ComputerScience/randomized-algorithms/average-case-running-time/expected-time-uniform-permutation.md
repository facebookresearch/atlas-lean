# Average formula for the expected time over random orderings

Let $A$ be an algorithm on
lists whose running time $T_A(y)$ on each list $y$ is a natural number, and let
$x = (x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$ be a list of length $n$. The expected running time of $A$ when its
input is $x$ rearranged by a uniformly random permutation equals

$$\frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma} T_A(x_{\sigma(0)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(n-1)}),$$

the sum running over all permutations $\sigma$ of $\{0, \dots, n-1\}$ and computed in
$[0, \infty]$.
