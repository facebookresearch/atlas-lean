# Lifts of a singular point with valuation one

Let $p$ be a prime, let
$f \in \mathbb{Z}[x, y]$ have partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$, and let $r, s$ be integers in
$\{0, \dots, p - 1\}$ such that $p$ divides $f(r, s)$, $f_x(r, s)$ and $f_y(r, s)$. Then the
number of pairs $(k, l)$ with $0 \le k, l < p$, $p \mid f(r + kp, s + lp)$ and
$p^2 \nmid f(r + kp, s + lp)$ is $0$ if $p^2 \mid f(r, s)$, and $p^2$ otherwise.

The cited statement prints the two cases swapped. By the paper's eq. (7) every lift
$f(r + kp, s + lp)$ is congruent to $f(r, s)$ modulo $p^2$. The printed version fails for
$f = x^2 + y^2 + 3$, $p = 3$, $(r, s) = (0, 0)$: $f(0, 0) = 3$ is not divisible by $9$, and all
$9$ lifts have valuation $1$.
