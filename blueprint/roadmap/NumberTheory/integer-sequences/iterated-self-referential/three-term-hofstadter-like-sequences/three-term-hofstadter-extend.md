# Computing further terms of a three-term Hofstadter-like sequence

Given terms
$B(1), \dots, B(m)$, padded with $0$ at nonpositive indices or not, and a natural number $k$,
this is the list $B(1), \dots, B(m + k)$ obtained by computing $B(m + 1), \dots, B(m + k)$ one
after another from $B(n) = B(n - B(n-1)) + B(n - B(n-2)) + B(n - B(n-3))$. It is undefined if
one of these terms cannot be computed because the formula refers to an undefined index (a
nonpositive index in the unpadded case, or an index not yet computed).
