# Exact length of a three-term Hofstadter-like sequence

Take integer initial conditions
$B(1), \dots, B(m)$, and either pad the sequence with $B(n) = 0$ for every $n \le 0$ or leave it
unpadded. Continue it by $B(n) = B(n - B(n-1)) + B(n - B(n-2)) + B(n - B(n-3))$ for $n > m$,
where a term cannot be computed if this formula refers to an undefined index: a nonpositive
index in the unpadded case, or an index not yet computed. For a natural number $T$, the
sequence has exactly $T$ terms when $T \ge m$, the terms $B(1), \dots, B(T)$ can all be
computed, and $B(T + 1)$ cannot.
