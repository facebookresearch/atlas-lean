# Base-3/2 digits of the next Josephus fixed point, gap at least two

Let $J_3$ be the
Josephus function with elimination step $3$, let $n_\ell$ be the $\ell$-th positive fixed point
of $J_3$ in increasing order (counting from $\ell = 0$), and let $m_\ell$ be the number of
integers $n$ with $n_\ell < n < n_{\ell+1}$ and $J_3(n) + 1 = n$ (the pure high extremal points
between them). For every $\ell$, if $m_\ell \ge 2$, then the base-$3/2$ digit list of
$n_{\ell+1}$, least significant digit first, is the digit $2$, then $m_\ell - 1$ digits equal to
$1$, then the digit $0$, followed by the digit list of $n_\ell$.

Written most significant digit first, this appends to the digits of $n_\ell$ a $0$, then
$m_\ell - 1$ ones, then a $2$. This is part (iii) of the cited Theorem 1.
