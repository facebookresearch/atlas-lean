# Log-balancedness of reciprocals along a three-term recurrence

Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be
real numbers with $c_2 \ge 0$, and let $(z_n)_{n \ge 0}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers
with $z_{n+1} = c_1 z_n - c_2 z_{n-2}$ for every $n \ge 2$. Write $w_n = 1/z_n$ and
$x_n = z_{n+1}/z_n$, and let $n_0 \ge 0$ be an integer. Suppose that for $n = n_0 + 1$ and
$n = n_0 + 2$

$$w_n^2 \le w_{n-1} w_{n+1} \quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{w_{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \cdot \frac{w_{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \le \left(\frac{w_n}{n!}\right)^2,$$

and that $c_1 x_n x_{n+1} \ge 3 c_2$ for every $n \ge n_0$. Then both inequalities hold for
every $n \ge n_0 + 1$; that is, the sequence $(1/z_n)_{n \ge n_0}$ is log-balanced (Došlić).

The paper also assumes $c_1 > 0$; this follows from positivity, the recurrence and $c_2 \ge 0$.
