# A subgroup of strong pseudoprime bases of a composite Fermat number

Let $k$ be a natural
number such that the Fermat number $F_k = 2^{2^k} + 1$ is composite, and let $S_k$ be the set of
residues modulo $F_k$ of the form $2^t$, $2^{2^{k-1}+t} + 2^t$ or $2^{2^{k-1}+t} - 2^t$ with $t$ a
natural number. Then the units of $\mathbb{Z}/F_k\mathbb{Z}$ that lie in $S_k$ form a subgroup of
the unit group of order $2^{k+2}$, and $F_k$ is a strong pseudoprime to every base in $S_k$.

The source also asserts that this subgroup is isomorphic to $C_{2^{k+1}} \times C_2$. This is
false: the residue $2^{16} + 1$ has multiplicative order $128 = 2^{k+2}$ modulo $F_5$, so the
subgroup is cyclic for $k = 5$.
