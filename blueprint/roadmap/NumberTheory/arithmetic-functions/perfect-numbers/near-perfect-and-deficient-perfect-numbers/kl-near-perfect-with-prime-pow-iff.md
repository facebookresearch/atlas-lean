# Prime powers that are $(k,\ell)$-near-perfect

Let $p$ be a prime, let $a$, $k$, $\ell$
and $d$ be natural numbers with $k \ge 1$ and $\ell \ge 1$, and write
$\sigma_k(m) = \sum_{e \mid m} e^k$. Then $d$ is a proper divisor of $p^a$ ($d \mid p^a$ and
$d < p^a$) with $\sigma_k(p^a) = (p^a)^k + d^k + \ell p^a$ if and only if $2 \le a \le k$,
$d = 1$ and $\ell = p^{k-a} \sum_{i=0}^{a-2} p^{ik}$.

The source prints the conclusion $a = k$, which is false: for $p = 2$, $a = 2$, $k = 3$,
$\ell = 2$, $d = 1$ one has $\sigma_3(4) = 73 = 4^3 + 1^3 + 2 \cdot 4$ with $a \ne k$. The
printed form is the case $a = k$ of the identity $\sum_{i=1}^{a-1} p^{ik} = \ell p^a$.
