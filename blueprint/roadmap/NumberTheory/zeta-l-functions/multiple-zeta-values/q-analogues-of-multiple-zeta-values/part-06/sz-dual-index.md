# The SZ dual index

Identify an index $k = (k_1, \dots, k_r)$ of natural numbers with the
word $p^{k_1} y \cdots p^{k_r} y$ in the letters $p$ and $y$, and let $\tilde\tau$ be the
anti-automorphism of words with $\tilde\tau(p) = y$ and $\tilde\tau(y) = p$ (reverse the word and
swap the letters). Write $\tilde\tau(p^{k_1} y \cdots p^{k_r} y)$ as $p^{a_1} y \cdots p^{a_s} y$
followed by a possibly empty run of letters $p$ (nonempty only when $k_1 = 0$); that run is
dropped, and the SZ dual index is $k^\dagger = (a_1, \dots, a_s)$.

For $k = (k_1, \{0\}^{d_1 - 1}, \dots, k_r, \{0\}^{d_r - 1})$ with all $k_i, d_i \ge 1$, where
$\{0\}^m$ stands for $m$ zeros, this gives
$k^\dagger = (d_r, \{0\}^{k_r - 1}, \dots, d_1, \{0\}^{k_1 - 1})$.
