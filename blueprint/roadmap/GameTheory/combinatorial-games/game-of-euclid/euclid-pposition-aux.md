# Fuel-bounded Euclid classifier

The fuel-bounded evaluation of the P-positions of Euclid is
the function $E(f, a, b)$ of natural numbers $f, a, b$ with Boolean values defined by recursion on
the fuel $f$. With no fuel, $E(0, a, b)$ is true. Otherwise $E(f + 1, a, b)$ is true when $a = b$,
$a = 0$ or $b = 0$; when $0 < a < b$ it is true iff $E(f, a, b - ja)$ is false for every $j \ge 1$
with $ja < b$; and when $0 < b < a$ it is true iff $E(f, a - jb, b)$ is false for every $j \ge 1$
with $jb < a$.

In Euclid a move replaces the larger entry by its difference with a positive multiple of the
smaller one, keeping both entries positive, and the player facing two equal entries (no move)
loses. With fuel at least $a + b$ the value is exact.
