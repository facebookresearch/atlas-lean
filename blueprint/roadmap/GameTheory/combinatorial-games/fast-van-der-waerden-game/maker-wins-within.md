# Maker wins within $p$ moves

Let $S$ be a finite set of natural numbers. In the
$S$-game, Maker and Breaker alternately claim unclaimed natural numbers, and Maker wins once the
numbers Maker has claimed contain a copy $aS + b = \{as + b : s \in S\}$ of $S$, where $a$ is a
positive integer and $b$ is an integer. Let $M$ and $B$ be finite sets of natural numbers
(claimed by Maker and by Breaker) and $p$ a natural number, with Maker to move. Maker wins
within $p$ moves if $M$ already contains such a copy of $S$, or if $p \ge 1$ and there is a
number $x \notin M \cup B$ such that for every number $y \ne x$ with $y \notin M \cup B$, Maker
wins within $p - 1$ moves from the position where Maker has claimed $M \cup \{x\}$ and Breaker
has claimed $B \cup \{y\}$.
