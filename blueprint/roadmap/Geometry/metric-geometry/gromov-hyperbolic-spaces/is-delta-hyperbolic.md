# Gromov $\delta$-hyperbolic space

A pseudometric space `X` is `δ`-hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) if `0 ≤ δ` and the
Gromov product satisfies the four-point inequality
`(x ∣ z)_w ≥ min (x ∣ y)_w (y ∣ z)_w - δ` for all points `w x y z`, where
`(x ∣ y)_w = Metric.gromovProduct w x y` (basepoint first, as in Mathlib).
