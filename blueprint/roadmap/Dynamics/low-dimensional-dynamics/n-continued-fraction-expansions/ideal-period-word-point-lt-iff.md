# The ideal periodic points decrease

Let $N$ be a natural number, let $\alpha$ be a real
number with $0 < \alpha \le \sqrt N - 1$, and let $T_\alpha$ be the $N$-expansion map on
$I_\alpha = [\alpha, \alpha + 1]$. For $m \ge 1$ write $|d_m|$ for the length of the digit string
of the ideal period word $d_m$. Let $k, \ell \ge 1$ and let $x, y \in I_\alpha$ be such that for
every $i \ge 0$ the digit of $T_\alpha^i(x)$ is entry $i \bmod |d_k|$ (counting from $0$) of the
digit string of $d_k$, and the digit of $T_\alpha^i(y)$ is entry $i \bmod |d_\ell|$ of the digit
string of $d_\ell$; that is, the expansions of $x$ and $y$ are purely periodic with period words
$d_k$ and $d_\ell$. Then $x < y$ if and only if $\ell < k$.

The source works in Phase I; only the assumption $0 < \alpha \le \sqrt N - 1$ is kept here, which
makes $T_\alpha$ expanding, so that a digit sequence determines its point.
