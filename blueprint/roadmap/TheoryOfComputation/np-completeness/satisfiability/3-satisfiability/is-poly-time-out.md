# Emitter reductions out of SAT are polynomial-time

Let $E$ be an emitter with finitely
many stacks, finite stack alphabets and finitely many labels, given together with a list of its
stacks that contains every stack exactly once. Write $B$ for the step bound of $E$, $g$ for its
output map and $o$ for its output on undecodable inputs, and let $p$ be a polynomial with
natural-number coefficients such that $2n + 3 + B(n) \le p(n)$ for every $n$. Then the map
sending a bit string $x$ to $g(\varphi)$ when $x$ is the binary code of a CNF formula $\varphi$
(its clause count in unary followed by the encoded clauses), and to $o$ otherwise, is
polynomial-time computable for the canonical bit-string encoding of lists of booleans.
