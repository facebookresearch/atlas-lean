# The MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY decision problem

MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY is the decision
problem that accepts a bitstring $x$ exactly when $x$ decodes, under the canonical bitstring
encoding, to a triple $(n, \varphi, K)$ of a natural number $n$, a CNF formula $\varphi$ with
clauses $C_0, \dots, C_{m-1}$ and a natural number $K$ such that every clause has at most two
literals, all with variables less than $n$, and some assignment of truth values to the variables
$0, \dots, n-1$ satisfies $C_j$ for at most $K$ indices $j < m$. Every other bitstring is
rejected.
