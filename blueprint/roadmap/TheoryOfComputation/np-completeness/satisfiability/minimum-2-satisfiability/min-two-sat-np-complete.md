# MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY is NP-complete

Let MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY be the decision
problem that accepts a bitstring $x$ exactly when $x$ decodes, under the canonical bitstring
encoding, to a triple $(n, \varphi, K)$ of a natural number $n$, a CNF formula $\varphi$ with
clauses $C_0, \dots, C_{m-1}$ and a natural number $K$ such that every clause has at most two
literals, all with variables less than $n$, and some assignment of truth values to the variables
$0, \dots, n-1$ satisfies $C_j$ for at most $K$ indices $j < m$. Then MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY
belongs to NP, and every decision problem $L$ in NP reduces to it by a polynomial-time many-one
reduction: there is a polynomial-time computable map $f$ on bitstrings such that, for every
bitstring $x$, $L$ accepts $x$ exactly when MINIMUM 2-SATISFIABILITY accepts $f(x)$.
