# SUBSET PRODUCT as a decision problem

The decision problem SUBSET PRODUCT accepts a
bitstring $x$ exactly when $x$ decodes, under the canonical bitstring encoding of pairs of a finite
list of natural numbers and a natural number, to an instance $(a, T)$ that is well formed (every
entry of $a$ is positive) and feasible (some sublist of $a$ has product exactly $T$). It rejects
every bitstring that does not decode to an instance.
