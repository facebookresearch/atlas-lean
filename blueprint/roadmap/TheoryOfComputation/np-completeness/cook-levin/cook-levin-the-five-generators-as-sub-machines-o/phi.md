# The formula emitted by the host

Let $M$ be a finite multi-stack Turing machine with
encoding data $E$, let $x$ and $Y$ be lists of input symbols, let $\mathit{acc}$ be an output
symbol, and let $m, T \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $H = m + (T + 1) d + 1$ be the stack cap, where $d$ is
the window depth of $M$. The CNF formula $\Phi(x, Y, \mathit{acc}, m, T)$ is the concatenation, in
this order, of the accept family for $\mathit{acc}$, the shift family, the situation-definition
family, the update family, and the init family for $x$, $Y$ and $m$, all at run length $T$ and
stack cap $H$.
