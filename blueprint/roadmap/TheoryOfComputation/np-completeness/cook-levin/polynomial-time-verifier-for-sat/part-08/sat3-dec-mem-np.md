# 3SAT is in NP

The decision problem 3SAT, which accepts exactly the bit strings that
encode a satisfiable CNF formula in which every clause has at most three literals, belongs to the
class NP.

The verifier is the SAT verifier host with the three-literal clause filter switched on, and
witnesses no longer than the input suffice.
