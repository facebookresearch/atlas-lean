# One clause of the one-hot generator

Let $L$ be a layout with $g$ symbol codes, let $c$
be a well-formed clause kind of a cell (the pair of an at-most-one kind is increasing), and let
$B$ and $V$ be natural numbers with $B + g \le V$. Let $F$ be counter values whose scratch
counters $Q$, $\mathrm{tmp}$, $\mathrm{md}$, $c_1$, $c_2$ are zero, whose cell-base counter
$\mathrm{CB}$ holds $B$, whose variable counter $\mathrm{Vc}$ holds $V$, and whose position
counter $P$ is zero. Then for every output word $o$ and every machine state $v$, the generator
of $L$ runs in at most $V(3V + 6) + g(6V + 9) + 3V + 4$ steps from the label that starts
clause $c$, with state $v$, counters $F$ and output $o$, to the label that follows clause $c$,
with state false, the same counters $F$, and output the encoding of the dense clause over $V$
variables whose literals are those of $c$ in the cell with base $B$, followed by $o$.
