# Halting of a composite

Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be single-tape Turing machines over the same
alphabet, and let $M$ be their composite, whose states are the disjoint union of those of $M_1$
and of $M_2$: $M$ starts in the start state of $M_1$ and runs $M_1$, where $M_1$ would halt it
enters the start state of $M_2$ instead, and it then runs $M_2$ and halts where $M_2$ halts. Say
that a machine outputs a word $w$ on a word $v$ when, started in its start state on a tape
holding $v$, it reaches the halted configuration whose tape holds exactly $w$, with the head at
the start of $w$. For all words $a$ and $b$ such that $M_1$ outputs $b$ on $a$: $M$, started in
its start state on a tape holding $a$, halts if and only if $M_2$, started in its start state on
a tape holding $b$, halts.
