# When one palindrome is a prefix of the next

Let $g_k$ be the $k$-th gap between
consecutive unsums (OEIS A260317), counted from zero, and let $m_0 < m_1 < \cdots$ be the
markers, the indices $k \ge 10$ with $g_k = 2$, in increasing order. For $i \ge 1$ let $W_i$
be the word of the gaps $g_k$ with $m_{2i-2} < k < m_{2i-1}$, in increasing order of $k$. Then
for every $i \ge 1$, the word $W_i$ is a prefix of $W_{i+1}$ if and only if $i$ is odd.
