# Lucky spots of weakly decreasing parking functions as a Catalan convolution

Number the
cars and spots $0, \dots, n-1$. For cars $i$ and spots $j$, let $q^d_n(i, j)$ be the number of
weakly decreasing parking functions $f$ of length $n$ (that is, $f(0) \ge f(1) \ge \dots \ge
f(n-1)$) with $f(i) = j$ in which car $i$ is lucky. Then for every spot $j$,

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} q^d_n(i, j) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-j-1} C_{n-1-k} \, C_k,$$

where $C_m$ is the $m$-th Catalan number.

The left side counts the weakly decreasing parking functions in which spot $j$ is lucky, that
is, taken by a car that prefers it.
