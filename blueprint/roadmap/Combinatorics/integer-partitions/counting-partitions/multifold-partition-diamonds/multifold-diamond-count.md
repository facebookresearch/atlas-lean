# Number of multifold partition diamonds

Let $d_1, \dots, d_M$ be natural numbers. Put
$L_k = \sum_{m=1}^{k} (d_m + 1)$ for $0 \le k \le M$ and $c = L_M + 1$. A multifold partition
diamond of shape $(d_1, \dots, d_M)$ is a sequence $(b_0, \dots, b_{c-1})$ of nonnegative integers
such that $b_{L_{k-1}} \le b_{L_{k-1} + f} \le b_{L_k}$ for all $1 \le k \le M$ and
$1 \le f \le d_k$. The parts $b_{L_0}, \dots, b_{L_M}$ are its links and the other parts are its
folds; its link sum is $\sum_{k=0}^{M} b_{L_k}$ and its fold sum is the sum of its folds. This is
the number of multifold partition diamonds of shape $(d_1, \dots, d_M)$ with fold sum $i$ and
link sum $j$.

Every part of such a diamond is at most $i + j$, so this number is finite.
