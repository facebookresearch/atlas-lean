# Generating function for lit cells of weakly decreasing bargraphs

Let
$P(q) = \sum_{n \ge 0} p(n) q^n$ be the partition generating function, for $k \ge 0$ let $T_q(k)$
be the generating function of partitions contained in the triangle with column heights
$k, k - 1, \ldots, 1$ (so $T_q(0) = 1$), and let $L(q) \in \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ be the power series
whose coefficient of $q^n$ is the total number of lit cells over all partitions of $n$ drawn as
weakly decreasing bargraphs. Then

$$L(q) = \sum_{k \ge 0} \bigl(P(q) - T_q(k)\bigr),$$

where the sum converges coefficientwise.
